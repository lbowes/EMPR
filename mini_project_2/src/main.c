// Overview
// The second mini project requires that you understand how to use I/O devices
// connected to the MPU’s i2c bus.

// Stage 1:
// Write a program that determines how many devices are connected to the i2c bus. Your
// program should print out “X devices connected to i2c bus” on the terminal, where X
// is the number of devices and it should list the i2c addresses at which devices are
// present.

// Stage 2:
// Write a program that writes “Hello World” on a single line on the
// small LCD display connected to the i2c bus. Modify your program to write
// each word on a separate line on the LCD display.

// Stage 3:
// Write a program that allows you to enter characters on your keypad
// and display the results on the small LCD. Try to develop your system so that
// it is responsive to key presses (no key presses missed) but also does not accept
// spurious multiple characters (eg. ‘22’ when only ‘2’was intended).

// Stage 4:
// Optional extra: Write a program that allows you to enter some
// numbers on the keypad and add, multiply, divide or subtract them, displaying
// the data entry and results on the LCD (i.e. a simple calculator).

// MP2 demonstration: Integrate your work into a single program that executes:
// • Stage 1, followed by a pause of 1 second.
// • Stage 2, with a pause of 1 second and a clear LCD screen after each of the two print operations.
// • Finally stage 3 above is executed.
