This directory should contain all common library functions for operating the
following different components on the embedded system:

- UART serial interface
- LEDs
- LCD display
- 7 segment display
- Keypad

As well as anything Constants.h, that should contain anything that is shared
at a component-level. This file could be removed if it doesn't contain anything
substantial at the end of the mini-projects.

Note: This directory should not contain anything project-specific (mini projects
or spring project).
